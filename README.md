Mapping literary texts to understand the intricacies of violence during the partition in 1947.
Questions we are trying to answer through this projects:
1. How is violence spread spatially?  
2. Was violence more of an outdoor phenomenon, as we perceive it to be, or do personal narratives reveal a private dimension to the violence? 
3. Who were the characters present at events of violence? Were they predominantly male, female? 
4. How differently did men and women experience violence? is there a pattern to this difference?
